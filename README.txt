This was my coursework for the second semester at the university. The requirements were to create some type of program that would consist of things we learned during that semester.

This cmd game was inspired by the popular smartphone game Geometry-dash. There are two options: play, or let the computer play and show you how to score 25/25. In this game, obstacles generate randomly every time you play. There are 5 levels, each level consists of 5 obstacles. After beating a level, the pace increases, so it gets progressively harder.
